                I am hard working and enthusiastic about learning new skills. I
                am well organised and always meet deadlines when they have been

                well independently. I have shown that I am a trustworthy and
                responsible person in school and at home. I have got very good
                communication skills which I feel will be useful when working in
                new situations. I enjoy travelling and have travelled to many
